# EU-US Data Privacy Framework – Current Status (English)

## Purpose

This skill provides an English-language assessment of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) as a transfer instrument under Article 45 GDPR. It is intended for use with international counsel, US in-house teams, or supervisory authorities in cross-border investigations.

## When you need this skill

- Reviewing whether a TIA is still required for a US importer.
- Documenting DPF listing in the RoPA / TIA.
- Strategic choice between DPF and SCCs.
- HR data transfers to a US parent; checking HR coverage.
- Preparing for potential CJEU invalidation (Schrems III).

## Legal framework

### Basis

- **Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/1795** of **10 July 2023** on the adequate protection of personal data under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
- US-side basis: **Executive Order 14086** of 7 October 2022 and DPF Principles issued by the Department of Commerce.
- Oversight: **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** and, for transportation carriers, **Department of Transportation (DOT)**.
- Redress: two-step mechanism via **Civil Liberties Protection Officer (CLPO)** and **Data Protection Review Court (DPRC)**.

### Listing process

- Self-certification with the US Department of Commerce.
- Annual re-certification.
- Published on the official DPF list at dataprivacyframework.gov.
- Three tracks: EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF, UK Extension – each must be elected separately.
- HR and Non-HR data must be declared separately.

### Scope and limits

- Applies only to **actively listed** US legal entities.
- Group-affiliated entities are not automatically covered; each legal person must be checked separately.
- Sub-processors / onward transfers: DPF Principles require contractual safeguards.
- Data outside the listing scope (e.g. a product not included in the certification declaration) – DPF does **not** cover.

### Residual risk

- FISA 702 and EO 12333 remain in effect; EO 14086 narrows but does not abolish them.
- The Schrems III action (NOYB) is pending; key issue: independence of the DPRC.
- If the decision is invalidated, DPF reliance ends; SCCs + TIA must take over (a return to the pure Schrems II landscape).

### EU review

- The Commission periodically reviews the effectiveness of the DPF; the **first review in summer 2024** confirmed the decision; further reviews are scheduled approximately every four years, with ad hoc reviews possible.

## / Checklist

1. **Verify the exact name** of the US entity in the DPF list.
2. **Check status** "Active"; if "Inactive" -> no DPF reliance.
3. Note **certification date** and **next re-certification**; capture a dated screenshot/PDF for the file.
4. Check **HR / Non-HR coverage**; HR must be separately elected.
5. Check **product / service coverage** against DPF declaration and privacy notice.
6. Review **onward transfer clauses** in the DPA (sub-processors outside the USA or outside the listing).
7. Add **DPRC notice** to data subject communications.
8. Add a **residual-risk memo** noting FISA 702 / EO 12333 and ongoing Schrems III observation.
9. Include a **fallback clause** in the contract: on revocation of the adequacy decision, automatic switch to SCCs + TIA.

### TIA Step 2 wording

> The transfer relies on Article 45 GDPR in conjunction with Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/1795. The importer is actively listed under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework as "..." with certification date [...] (see Annex DPF Check Note). The listing covers [HR / Non-HR] data and the services contractually rendered under this engagement.
>
> Residual risk arising from FISA Section 702 and Executive Order 12333 remains. The Schrems III proceedings at the General Court of the European Union are pending; in the event of invalidation, the contractual fallback clause activates the Standard Contractual Clauses under Decision (EU) 2021/914 with corresponding TIA (see Annex Fallback Transfer Tool).

## Common mistakes

- "Our parent company is listed" – the subsidiary is a separate legal entity and must be listed individually.
- HR data transferred but the listing only covers Non-HR.
- The entity is on the list but the privacy policy refers to data categories not included in the declaration.
- Re-certification date has passed – listing is inactive but transfer continues.
- Onward transfer to a further third country is missed.
- No fallback clause; on Schrems III invalidation the transfer has no basis.
- Confusing Swiss-US DPF with EU-US DPF.
