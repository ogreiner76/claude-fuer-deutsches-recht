# Transfer Impact Assessment – EDPB Six-Step Roadmap (English)

## Purpose

This skill provides the English-language operational walk-through of EDPB Recommendation 01/2020 (Final Version 18 June 2021). It is the standard architecture for a TIA document and should be used together with the EU-US DPF status check, the FISA 702 / EO 12333 assessment, and the supplementary measures catalogue.

## When you need this skill

- Drafting a first TIA for a specific transfer with an English-speaking team.
- Coordinating with US in-house counsel.
- Filing a TIA with a supervisory authority in a cross-border case.
- Vendor diligence (SOC 2, ISO 27001) requesting evidence of TIA compliance.
- Training internal reviewers in English-speaking entities.

## Legal framework

- **CJEU C-311/18** Schrems II of 16 July 2020.
- **EDPB Recommendation 01/2020** "Recommendations on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data" (adopted 10 November 2020; Final Version 18 June 2021).
- **EDPB Recommendation 02/2020** "European Essential Guarantees for surveillance measures" of 10 November 2020.
- Articles 44–49 GDPR.

## / Checklist

### Step 1 – Know your transfers

Aim: map every transfer.

Verify:

- What data are transferred? Direct export, remote access, onward transfers?
- Who is exporter (controller or processor)?
- Who is importer (country, legal entity, group affiliation)?
- Which data categories? Special categories (Art. 9 GDPR)?
- Sub-processors and sub-sub-processors?
- Processing purposes and data flows (including internal flows at the importer).

Output: a transfer inventory table.

### Step 2 – Identify transfer tool

Aim: determine the legal basis for the transfer.

Options:

- **Article 45 GDPR – Adequacy decision** (e.g. UK, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, EU-US DPF for listed importers).
- **Article 46 GDPR – Appropriate safeguards**:
 - Standard Contractual Clauses (Decision (EU) 2021/914, modules 1-4),
 - Binding Corporate Rules (Art. 47),
 - Approved Codes of Conduct or certifications,
 - DPA-issued contractual clauses.
- **Article 49 GDPR – Derogations** (consent, contract performance, legal claims) – strict reading; not for routine flows.

If Art. 45 applies, the TIA may be limited to Steps 1, 2, and 6 for the covered scope.

### Step 3 – Assess law and practice

Aim: evaluate third-country law and actual practice.

Check:

- Which authorities have access powers?
- What is the intensity of access? What safeguards exist (judicial control, suspicion-based access)?
- Apply Recommendation 02/2020 – European Essential Guarantees (EEG):
 - Guarantee A: rules must be clear, precise, and foreseeable.
 - Guarantee B: necessity and proportionality.
 - Guarantee C: independent oversight mechanism.
 - Guarantee D: effective remedies for the data subject.
- Are the guarantees met in law **and** in practice?

Sources for assessment: official reports, importer transparency reports, EDPB guidance, peer-reviewed public analyses.

### Step 4 – Adopt supplementary measures

If Step 3 negative: implement supplementary measures.

Three categories:

- **Technical measures** (often decisive): strong encryption with key management outside the third country; pseudonymisation with un-correlated keys; split processing; no clear-text access by the importer.
- **Contractual measures**: enhanced audit and transparency rights, reporting obligations on government requests, warrant canary, immediate suspension obligations.
- **Organisational measures**: staff training, escalation processes, vendor reviews, documented challenge policy.

Annex 2 of Recommendation 01/2020 lists Use Cases 1-7 (Use Cases 6 and 7 are scenarios where no effective measures are possible).

### Step 5 – Procedural steps

If supplementary measures are required:

- Update the DPA.
- Complete SCC Annexes I, II, III.
- Where SCCs are supplemented (added clauses, not deleted) – consider supervisory authority consultation.
- For BCRs – notify the Lead DPA of updates.
- Obtain authorisation where required.

### Step 6 – Re-evaluate

Re-assess on triggers:

- Changes in third-country law (statutes, court rulings).
- Changes in agency practice.
- Importer changes (group structure, sub-processors, services).
- Exporter changes (new data categories, new purposes).
- At minimum annually.

## Common mistakes

- Step 1 incomplete: only direct transfers identified; onward transfers ignored.
- Step 2: DPF chosen but the importer is not actively listed.
- Step 3: only abstract legal analysis without checking actual practice.
- Step 4: contractual measures alone without technical underpinning – per EDPB usually inadequate.
- Step 5: SCC text altered substantively rather than merely supplemented.
- Step 6: no review schedule.
- TIA prepared but not formally placed on file.
