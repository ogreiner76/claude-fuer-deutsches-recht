# DPIA Management Summary in English

## Purpose

Concise English-language management summary of a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under Art. 35 GDPR. Designed for board members, executive committees, group risk officers and other non-legal stakeholders who require a defensible one-pager rather than the full DPIA document. The summary follows the six-step methodology and ends with an explicit approval recommendation.

## When to use

- When a DPIA is on the agenda of a board, executive committee or steering committee
- For investor due diligence covering high-risk processing
- For internal audit and group risk reporting in English
- For exchange with English-speaking parent companies, joint controllers or processors
- For cross-border consultation drafts that later are translated into national language

## Legal framework

- Art. 35(7) GDPR mandatory content of a DPIA
- Art. 35(2) GDPR DPO consultation
- Art. 36 GDPR prior consultation if residual risk remains high
- Art. 5(2) GDPR accountability principle
- EDPB Guidelines WP 248 rev.01 on DPIA
- For AI-related processing: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 Art. 26 and Art. 27

## 6-step structure of the management summary

1. **Description of processing.** One paragraph: purpose, data, subjects, technology, transfers.
2. **Necessity and proportionality assessment.** One paragraph: legal basis, minimisation, alternatives.
3. **Risk to data subjects.** Short risk table with the top scenarios.
4. **Measures to mitigate risk.** Short list of key measures.
5. **Residual risk.** Risk rating before and after measures.
6. **Approval recommendation.** Approve, approve with conditions, prior consultation under Art. 36, do not approve.

## Typical mistakes

- Management summary uses different wording than the full DPIA — inconsistency creates legal risk.
- Risk table is reduced to a single rating without scenarios — board cannot challenge.
- Approval recommendation is hidden in narrative — should be a binary choice.
- DPO opinion is not referenced — looks like a controller-only decision.
- Cross-border or AI specifics omitted in the summary even though they are key in the full DPIA.
- No action items with owner and deadline — recommendation is not actionable.
- Confidentiality classification missing — risk of unintended disclosure.
